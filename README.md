# Sprint6_TaylorsVersion
First project exploring virtual environments, miniconda programs, and app rendering with TripleTen's Data Analytics Program. I sourced a free dataset about Taylor Swift Song Tracks from Kaggle.com, and built several different figures throughout the project meant to simulate random events. 

This full list of programs and the versions used can be found in the requirements.txt file of the directory, but all of the actual data exploration, cleaning, chart building, and streamlit work happened in VSCode. I pulled inspiration from the program workshop, and was able to use those skills in a dataset that was more relevant and interesting to me. 

Throughout the EDA_S6.ipynb file, I tried to give brief descriptions of the charts and steps used to make it a user friendly experience on the back end, as well as the app that can be interacted with and used on the front end.
